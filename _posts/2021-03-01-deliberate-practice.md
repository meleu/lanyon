Today I learned about the details of what deliberate practice really is: <http://nautil.us/issue/35/boundaries/not-all-practice-makes-perfect>

Deliberate practice...:

- ... has well-defined, specific goals.
    - it's all about putting a bunch of babysteps together to reach a longer-term goal.
    - break it down and make a plan.

- ... is focused.
    - you seldom improve much without giving the task your full attention.

- ... involves feedback.
    - without feedback - either from yourself or from outside observers - you cannot figure out what you need to improve on or how close you are to achieving your goals.

- ... requires getting out of one's comfort zone.
    - it means tryint to do something that you couldn't do before.
    - sometimes you may find it relatively easy, but sometimes you run into something that stops you cold. Finding ways around these barriers is one of the hidden keys.
    - try harder != try differently
